[TANN](https://translate.google.com.br/#ht/en/tann) is a simple project developed
during a Hackathon organized by Leroy Merlin, to save small amounts of water
during simple tasks done daily in the Water Tap.

It's solution is based on a simple circuit to detect capacitance and allow the
system to detect touches on the water tap, "pausing" the water flux by closing
a valve.

An extra to the circuit, is the use of an [ESP8266](https://pt.wikipedia.org/wiki/ESP8266)
to send notifications about how much water was saved every day/week on your
email or any other service you want (to implement).

### Important Notices
* Your water MUST have conductivity over it's painting
  (Test conductivity with multimeter over it's body)
